## What is this project

Bookwise is a project developed as part of the Ignite course by Rocketseat. It is the sixth challenge of the course and aims to create a recommendation platform for readers.

The main features of the platform include the ability for users to rate books, view ratings from other users, search for books, add books to a wishlist, and recommend books to others.

Throughout the development process, important web development concepts are applied, such as creating APIs, working with databases, building responsive interfaces, and implementing authentication and authorization.
